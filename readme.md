## Part 1 - First Gaming

> The first "downloaded" game I played isnt Minecraft, its Undertale. I used to watch and love Stick Figure animations, specifically Alan Becker's. He had another channel featuring him playing with DJ and sometimes others. They released a video of them playing Undertale. It didnt seem special to me, but anyways, I googled about it. Still, it looked like a basic indie game. But thats when I watched them play. It was AMAZING!  I really wanted to play it, so I did. I downloaded Undertale "for free" and played it. It was dope fr. I played all routes and completely finished it. Then, I tried to find more related pixel games, focusing on Browser games. Thats when I stumbled on the Demo Web version of Aground. That was also cool. So I saved it and loaded the world on the Full Game after installing Aground! Anyways, after that, I played Stardew Valley, it was cool and all, but I stopped playing. 

## Part 2 - Eaglercraft

> After 5th grade, I went to Dubai for Vacation. It was amazing since I never had Wi-Fi at home, and there it had. My dad gave me a basic PC setup and started to watch movies and play games. And then, I wanted to play Minecraft, but I didnt want to download it. So I searched Minecraft for free in Google, and thats when I stumbled upon a remake of Minecraft 1.8 which can be played in the browser, Eaglercraft. Then, I played a server called "B2Server". It was my soul. I made alot of friends and it was really peaceful (even though I did get *kinda* betrayed) since it had Keep Inventory on, Briefing protection and Functional Blocks ownership plugin. But, it became really sad when I went back to Home.

> **Friends I made in Eaglercraft: Galaxy, MrMilkShake, Demon_Lord and 1 more (i forgot)**
