## Part 1 - First Gaming

The first "downloaded" game I played isnt Minecraft, its Undertale. I used to watch and love Stick Figure animations, specifically Alan Becker's. He had another channel featuring him playing with DJ and sometimes others. They released a video of them playing Undertale. It didnt seem special to me, but anyways, I googled about it. Still, it looked like a basic indie game. But thats when I watched them play. It was AMAZING!  I really wanted to play it, so I did. I downloaded Undertale "for free" and played it. It was dope fr. I played all routes and completely finished it. Then, I tried to find more related pixel games, focusing on Browser games. Thats when I stumbled on the Demo Web version of Aground. That was also cool. So I saved it and loaded the world on the Full Game after installing Aground! Anyways, after that, I played Stardew Valley, it was cool and all, but I stopped playing.
